### Data Management Knowledge Areas:

• **Data Governance** – planning, oversight, and control over management of data and the use of data and data-related resources. While we understand that governance covers ‘processes’, not ‘things’, the common term is Data Governance, and so we will use this term.

• **Data Architecture** – the overall structure of data and data-related resources as an integral part of the enterprise architecture.

• **Data Modeling & Design** – analysis, design, building, testing, and maintenance \(was Data Development in the DAMA-DMBOK 1st edition\).

• **Data Storage & Operations** – structured physical data assets storage deployment and management \(was Data Operations in the DAMA-DMBOK 1st edition\).

• **Data Security **– ensuring privacy, confidentiality and appropriate access to PII, PHI and an individuals private data. Ensuring network security as well.

• **Data Integration & Interoperability** – acquisition, extraction, transformation, movement, delivery, replication, federation, virtualization and operational support \( a Knowledge Area new in DMBOK2\).

• **Documents & Content** – storing, protecting, indexing, and enabling access to data found in unstructured sources \(electronic files and physical records\), and making this data available for integration and interoperability with structured \(database\) data.

• **Reference & Master Data** – Managing shared data to reduce redundancy and ensure better data quality through standardized definition and use of data values.

• **Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence** – managing analytical data processing and enabling access to decision support data for reporting and analysis.

• **Metadata** – collecting, categorizing, maintaining, integrating, controlling, managing, and delivering metadata.

• **Data Quality** – defining, monitoring, maintaining data integrity, and improving data quality.
